tmplsql is a C++ library for type safe access to the results from a 
relational database management system (RDMS)

At the present it only supports postgresql, however a Sybase version
is definatly in the works.  It is relatively easy to add support for
the RDMS of your choice by modifing the tmplsql::rdms class.

At the moment the only documentation for the library is generated by
docbook comments in the source code.  It may be viewed at the
libraries homepage at: http://www.stitt.org/code/tmplsql/

Please read the install file for brief install instructions.

There is an additional layer that I have written that goes above this
library which creates sql queries 'on the fly', however I'm not
entirely happy with it's design, and will add it when I am.
