 *
 * \section intro C++ database access library
 *
 *    tmplsql is a C++ library for type safe access to the results from a 
 *    relational database management system (RDMS)
 *
 *    At the present it only supports Postgresql, however a Sybase version
 *    is in the works.  It is relatively easy to add support for
 *    the RDMS of your choice by modifying the tmplsql::rdms class.
 *
 * \section download Downloading
 *
 *    The library may be downloaded from
 *    http://www.stitt.org/code/tmplsql/src/
 *    Make sure you pick the tar.gz file with the highest version number.
 *
