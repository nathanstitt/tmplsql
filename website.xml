      tmplsql is a C++ library for type safe access to the results from a 
      relational database management system (RDMS)
    </para>
    <para>
      The library may be downloaded from
      <ulink url="http://www.stitt.org/code/tmplsql/src/">http://www.stitt.org/code/tmplsql/src/</ulink>
      Make sure you pick the tar.gz with the highest version number.

    <para>
      At the present it only supports Postgresql, however a Sybase version
      is defiantly in the works.  It is relatively easy to add support for
      the RDMS of your choice by modifying the tmplsql::rdms class.

    <para>
      At the moment the only documentation for the library is generated by
      doxygen comments in the source code.  It may be viewed at
      <ulink url="http://www.stitt.org/code/tmplsql/docs/">http://www.stitt.org/code/tmplsql/docs/</ulink>

      Please read the INSTALL file included in the source tar.gz file for brief install instructions.

      There is an additional layer that I have written that goes above this
      library which creates sql queries 'on the fly', however I'm not
      entirely happy with it's design, and will add it when I am.
    </para>
    <para>
      The library is Free Software, available under the terms of the Lesser
      General Public License.  Take it and do to it what you will.
